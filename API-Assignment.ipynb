    "Answer(Q2):\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Improved Efficiency: \n",
    "        API driven infrastructures enable developers to reuse code and functionality from existing software systems, saving time and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.\n",
    "        \n",
    "2.Increased Flexibility:\n",
    "        APIs provide developers with greater flexibility, enabling them to choose the best programming languages and frameworks for their needs. \n",
    "3.Increased Interoperability: \n",
    "        API solutions enable different software systems to communicate with each other, regardless of their programming language or platform. This enhances the interoperability between systems, allowing for the exchange of data and functionality.        \n",
    "        \n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Complexity:\n",
    "     APIs can be complex, requiring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain.\n",
    " \n",
    "2.Security Concerns: \n",
    "       API infrastructures can be vulnerable to security breaches, such as SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, making it crucial to implement security measures to protect against these threats. \n",

    "Web API:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web API as the name suggests, is an API over the web which can be accessed using HTTP protocol.\n",
